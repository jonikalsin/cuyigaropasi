games.</p><p>Leeds lost 4-1 to Bournemouth on Sunday, while City were held to a 1-1 draw by West Ham United on Tuesday.</p><p>Here is how the teams could line up today, based on the latest news and stats.</p><h2><span id=Leeds_United>Leeds United</span></h2><p>Leeds manager <a href=#>Sam Allardyce</a> is expected to make some changes to his starting XI, after criticising his players for their lackluster performance against Bournemouth.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1204 height=643 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/een8jo53vqo.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/leeds.jpg alt="An image

who has conceded 14 goals in his last four games and replace him with Joel Robles, who made his debut for the club in the Carabao Cup last week.</p><p>In defense, Pascal Struijk could return from suspension and partner Maxence Lacroix at center-back, with Luke Ayling and Junior Firpo as the full-backs.</p><p>In midfield, Adam Forshaw and Marc Roca could keep their places, with Weston McKennie providing some energy and drive.</p><p>On the wings, Crysencio Summerville and Jack Harrison could offer some pace and creativity, while Patrick Bamford could lead the line as the lone striker.</p><p>Leeds United predicted lineup (4-2-3-1): Robles; Ayling, Struijk, Lacroix, Firpo; Forshaw, Roca; Summerville, McKennie, Harrison; Bamford.</p><h2><span id=Manchester_City>Manchester City</span></h2><p>Manchester City boss <a href=#>Pep Guardiola</a> could also rotate his squad, after admitting that some of his players were tired after the World Cup break.</p><img

give Scott Carson a rare start in goal, while also bringing in Kyle Walker, Aymeric Laporte, and Nathan Ake for Joao Cancelo, Ruben Dias, and John Stones in defense.</p><p>In midfield, Rodri could anchor the trio, with Kevin De Bruyne and Bernardo Silva as the advanced playmakers.</p><p>In attack, Riyad Mahrez and Phil Foden could flank Erling Haaland, who is looking to add to his 20 goals in 14 Premier League games this season.</p><p>Manchester City predicted lineup (4-3-3): Carson; Walker, Laporte, Ake, Zinchenko; Rodri, De Bruyne, Bernardo; Mahrez, Haaland, Foden.</p><h2><span id=Stats>Stats</span></h2><p>Leeds have lost their last seven Premier League games against Manchester City, conceding 20 goals and scoring just two in that run.</p><p>Manchester City have won their last 10 away Premier League games by an aggregate score of 25-32.</p><p>They are one win away from equalling the record of 11 consecutive away wins in the competition set by Chelsea in 2008.</p><p>Leeds have conceded 41 goals in their 18 Premier League games this season – only Norwich (42) have conceded more.</p><p>They have also kept just one clean sheet in their last 12 league

goals in his last six league games.</p><p>Leeds has scored just four goals in their last eight Premier League games. Only Norwich (three) scored fewer in that period.</p><h2><span id=Prediction>Prediction</span></h2><p>Manchester City is the clear favorite to win this game, given their superior form and quality.</p><p>Leeds will try to make it difficult for them with their high-intensity style, but they are likely to struggle defensively against City’s potent attack.</p><p>Haaland could be the difference-maker once again for the visitors, who should secure a comfortable victory.</p><p>Prediction: Leeds United 0-3 Manchester City</p><p></p><p>If you found this article impressive follow for more on our blog page as sampled below:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnq6urMHNnaBnm5%2BifK2xxJ2qZq2ensGmsIyvqmalkaN6pLXTsmSloZ6awrG%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-end-of-an-era-rhobh-moves-on-from-lisa-vanderpump-and-films-first-scenes-with-garcelle-beauvais-319495.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The End Of An Era: RHOBH Moves On From Lisa Vanderpump and Films First Scenes With Garcelle B</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./josh-hutcherson-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Josh Hutcherson Net Worth: Earnings and Investments,Personal Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./caden-conrique.html>Caden Conrique (Actor) Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Dating, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Career, Fac</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eva-longoria-net-worth.html>Eva Longoria Net Worth: Lifestyle &amp;amp; Income</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-zolciak-biermann.html>Kim Zolciak-Biermann Height, Weight, Age, Spouse, Family, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-controversy-surrounding-fsu-football.html>The Controversy Surrounding FSU Football</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-lance-armstrong-and-astronaut-neil-armstrong-related.html>Are Lance Armstrong and Astronaut Neil Armstrong related?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ.
