Unfortunately, if you're accessing those services through a standard cable provider, you're likely paying a pretty penny for them. According to a 2020 report from DecisionData.org, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>average household cable package</a> in the U.S. costs $214.42 a monthâ€”that's nearly $2,600 a year. In fact, the report notes that cable has become the single priciest household utility for most Americans. That doesn't mean you need to continue paying through the nose for cable, however.<strong> There's one simple way to get the price of your cable services slashed: Just threaten to leave.</strong></p><p>"Cable companies know that it's much more costly for them to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing customer," says <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>financial advisor</a>&nbsp;<strong>Charles H. Thomas III</strong>, founder of Intrepid Eagle Finance. Once you do this, companies will typically put you in touch with a retention specialist, who will go over options that can potentially keep you with your existing cable company.</p><p>"This could include less costly packages that have fewer channels or other options," Thomas says. "Some will outright lower your bill if you offer to stay." But if you want to take a less drastic approach to slashing your monthly cable costs, read on to discover more expert-backed tips for lowering your cable bill.

"You can save a lot of money this way, instead of having multiple packages from different people."

"Cutting out the channels you don't watch or stepping back to a package with fewer channels can greatly reduce your monthly cable bill."

Just call your cable company and let them know what other promotions you've found and you may be able to get a price match.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/digital-tv-antenna.jpg><p>If you want to keep the local channels you love while ditching your expensive cable contract, invest in a digital antenna.</p><p>"There are lots of affordable indoor and outdoor options to choose from online, and in general, today's antennas are more reliable than the antennas of the past," says financial services expert <strong>John Schmoll</strong>, founder of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>FrugalRules.com</a>. However, before you buy that antenna, make sure you know the strength of your local broadcast signals and figure out which stations you can actually tune into.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/kids-watching-netflix-on-big-screen-tv.jpg><p>There's a reason millions of people have jumped ship from cable companies in favor of <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>streaming services</a>: Doing so can save you big.</p><p>"The quality of internet streaming these days is excellent, and there are a variety of content providers that offer bundles for a fraction of the price of cable," says financial expert <strong>Cyrus Vanover</strong>, founder of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>The Frugal Budgeter</a>. Vanover recommends combining <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>streaming platforms</a> with services like Tubi TV to get all the content you're used to for a fraction of the price.
