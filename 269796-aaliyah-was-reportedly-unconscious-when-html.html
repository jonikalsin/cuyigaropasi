She was on board a twin-engine Cessna 402 light aircraft traveling from the Bahamas to the US.</p><p class=Fg>The plane crashed and caught fire shortly after taking off. Aaliyah and eight other persons on board the aircraft died in the crash.</p><p class=Fg>Later, details about the plane crash <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.biography.com/news/aaliyah-plane-crash-died>revealed</a> that the aircraft was significantly over its allotted weight by several hundred pounds. It also had one more passenger than it was certified for.</p><p class=Fg>The weight in the plane was also improperly distributed, making it difficult to control once airborne. In addition to all of these, it was also discovered that the plane's pilot, Luis Morales III, possessed fake certifications, which he did to get his license.</p><p class=Fg>It was also <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.mtv.com/news/1456119/cocaine-alcohol-found-in-pilot-of-aaliyahs-plane/>revealed</a> that he had cocaine and alcohol in his system at the time of the plane crash. Meanwhile, new details about Aaliyah's condition before the crash have emerged.</p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>After the crash, Aaliyah's parents, Diane and Michael Haughton, sued Blackhawk International Airways Corp.</strong></h3><p class=Fg>Kingsley Russell, a Bahaman man who spent time with Aaliyah hours before she died in the plane accident, has revealed she never wanted to get on the stricken aircraft. He also claimed she was given sleeping pills hours before boarding the plane.</p><p class=Fg>Kingsley was just 13 years old when Aaliyah died. His family operated a taxi and hospitality franchise in the Abaco Islands. With his aunt, Annie Russell's influence, Kingsley worked with Aaliyah's entourage as the baggage carrier for her team.</p><p class=Fg>Kingsley was with Aaliyah on the night she died as his stepmom drove the deceased star's team for her return trip to the US. He claimed that when Aaliyah saw the plane, she refused to board it and went back to sleep in the taxi his stepmom was driving.</p><p class=Fg>Aaliyah passed out in the back of the taxi, and her team ultimately <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9850459/Singer-Aaliyah-sleeping-pill-unconscious-carried-plane-fatally-crashed-2001.html>carried her</a> onto the plane while she slept. This was despite her initial refusal to board the plane. However, her fears proved to be justified after the plane crashed, leaving all its occupants dead.</p><p class=Fg>After remaining silent for 20 years, Kingsley, now 33, is speaking out about what happened hours before the tragic plane crash. He made his revelations in a new book titled "Baby Girl: Better Known as Aaliyah," written by music journalist Kathy Iandoli.</p><p class=Fg>Since Aaliyah's passing, Iandoli has always been curious as to why the singer, known to be a nervous flier, insisted on boarding an overweight plane despite the chance of boarding a chartered plane the next day.</p><p class=Fg>In a reported interview, she recalled being upset because of stories that claimed Aaliyah was adamant about flying that night and wondered why she needed to fly so badly.</p><p class=Fg>However, Kingsley's revelations that Aaliyah never wanted to board the plane and was taken into it asleep have given Iandoli and many others like her closure.</p><p class=Fg>Iandoli said that despite the closure being unfortunate, she needed to hear that Aaliyah did not want to get on the plane. Iandoli said <a class="Xd a" href=#>Aaliyah</a> should still be alive, which is the saddest part about her demise because she deserved better.</p><p class=Fg>Kingsley's revelations go a long way in <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=102736">answering</a> many questions that emerged following Aaliyah's passing.
