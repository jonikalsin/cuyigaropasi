Back in the year, she was a 20-year-old girl who was just rising in fame with her show, Never Have I Ever. She has succeeded in keeping her relationship situation a secret. She hasn't mentioned having a significant other and hasn't been seen out and about with anyone romantically. She didn't drop any hints regarding her partner in 2021.</p><p>Also Her social media pages offered no hints as to whom she was dating either. She prefers keeping her relationship affairs private. Many fans linked her with her costar, <strong>Darren Barnet </strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>@darrenbasnet</a>). Some have even questioned whether Maitreyi Ramakrishnan and Jaren Lewison's relationship.</p><h2>Meet Maitreyi Ramakrishnan’s Rumored Boyfriend, Darren Basnet, and Jaren Lewison Since 2021!</h2><p>As the coronavirus outbreak was still continuing when the first season of the Netflix series, Never Have I Ever, debuted. Fans were smitten by Devi, a fictional high school student, right away for her straightforward approach to handling her love life. In addition to connecting with <strong>Maitreyi Ramakrishnan</strong>'s role, viewers also adored her relationship with her co-stars, <strong>Darren Barnet</strong> (Paxton) and <strong>Jaren Lewison</strong> (Ben) (<a href=# rel=noopener>@jarenlewison</a>). Fans began linking and wondered if she was either dating Darren or Jaren since 2021.</p><p>Some have even questioned whether Maitreyi Ramakrishnan and Darren Barnet are dating since their on-screen chemistry is so strong. The Never Have I Ever cast members are single. They are just friends. I understand that their smoldering on-screen chemistry might lead you to believe otherwise, but they are simply not more than friends in real life.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/06/maitreyi-ramakrishnan-boyfriend-2021-1.jpg alt="Maitreyi Ramakrishnan was rumored to be dating Darren Basnet. celebsindepth.com" width=576 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Maitreyi Ramakrishnan was rumored to be dating Darren Basnet.<br></strong><strong>Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>In reality, the actor made his red-carpet debut in August 2021 at the Los Angeles premiere of The Suicide Squad alongside girlfriend, <strong>Mikaela Hoover</strong>.
