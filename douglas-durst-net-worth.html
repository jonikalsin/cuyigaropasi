His son, Alexander Durst is responsible for development and operations in the company. Douglas’ right leg was also amputated in 2015.

He also has an estranged brother, Robert who was acquitted of a charge of murdering and dismembering his neighbor, but is also suspected of the disappearance and death of his wife Kathleen.
