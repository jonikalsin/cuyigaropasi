songs as, Bad, Thriller, Smooth Criminal, Dangerous, and The Way You Make Me Feel.</p><p>He is dubbed The King of Pop and is the <a href=#>most awarded musical artist in history.</a></p><p>The Billie Jean and Beat It singer <a href=#>went into cardiac arrest</a> and died at his&nbsp;Los Angeles&nbsp;home on June 25, 2009.</p><p>The pop star had been rehearsing past midnight on the night of June 24, ahead of a series of comeback concerts at the London O2 Arena, and had not left his bedroom in the morning.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000573419700.jpg><p>After trying to revive Jackson for five to ten minutes without effect, Conrad Murray, his personal physician, called paramedics who performed CPR on the singer for 42 minutes at his house in the Holmby Hills in Los Angeles, before he was taken to the hospital.</p><p>Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication.</p><p>The superstar performer was 50 years old.</p><p>Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for improperly administering the drugs that led to Jackson’s death.</p><p>He went on to serve time in prison.</p><h2><span>How many kids did Michael Jackson have?</span></h2><p>Michael Jackson had two children&nbsp;with his second wife Debbie Rowe and one from an unnamed donor.</p><p>The children he had with Rowe were Michael Joseph Jackson Jr, also known as Prince, in 1997 and Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson in 1998.</p><p>His third child Prince Michael Jackson II, nicknamed Blanket, was born in 2002 to an unnamed mother.</p><p>The youngest Jackson has since changed his name officially to “Bigi” after it was revealed he was bullied as a result of the nickname his dad gave him.</p><p>Blanket was infamously dangled over the balcony of a Berlin hotel room shortly after his birth by his dad as the paparazzi waited outside.</p><p>Paris was 11, Prince was 12 and Blanket was 7 when their famous father died.</p><p>Michael Jackson’s only daughter, Paris, has openly discussed her struggles with mental health.</p><p>She revealed in a 2017 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>&nbsp;– after turning 18 – that it took her years to find peace in her life.</p><p>She admitted that she has tried to take her own life multiple times and was addicted to food and self-harming.</p><p>“They always say, ‘Time heals,’” she told the magazine.</p><p>“But it really doesn’t. You just get used to it.</p><p>“I live life with the mentality of ‘OK, I lost the only thing that has ever been important to me.’</p><p>“So going forward, anything bad that happens can’t be nearly as bad as what happened before.</p><p>“So I can handle it.”</p><h2>What did Prince Jackson say about his siblings?</h2><p>On October 28, 2021, Prince Jackson – the eldest of the Jackson children – spoke in a rare interview with Good Morning Britain.</p><p>He talked about his invincible relationship with his siblings, and the emphasis his father put on treating the people closest to him well.</p><p>“When we were growing up, my father would say, ‘We could have nothing, but you look around in this room, your brother, your sister, and me, that’s all you’ll ever have,” he said.</p><p>“And that always stuck with my siblings and I, and we have such a close relationship. Because I’m the oldest, my father would always tell me [that] I have to make sure that the group is taken care of and that I have to be the leader and lead by example. But, after his passing, and us being thrown into the ‘real world,’ my siblings honestly—they picked up the slack that I unfortunately left behind.”</p><p>Prince continued:</p><p>“Any moment I get to spend with my siblings now, especially as we’re getting older and our own lives are starting to kind of blossom and grow-</p><p>“Every moment that I get with them—any little family dinner, any little family outing—is really a special moment for me.”</p><p>Aside from being incredibly close, Prince and Paris have also worked together on music. Prince produced a music video for Paris and her band in July of 2020.</p><p>Prince believes philanthropy to be his main goal in life, and is working to help fund educational resources for children.</p><p>“You have to keep pushing forward and it’s important that we do this. And [my father’s] kind of always on my shoulder, in my ear, motivating me to keep that moral compass pointing North.”</p><h2><span>What did Paris Jackson say about her dad?</span></h2><p>Paris revealed that her superstar father encouraged her to follow her musical dreams as young as 11 years old.</p><p>Paris, now 23, released her first single on October 29, 2020.</p><p>“No matter what it was we were interested in, I remember at one point I wanted to be an astronaut, he was like ‘do it. do it. Educate yourself as much as possible then go with it’ with every aspect of life,” Paris said.</p><p>She went on to say how music was a positive “purge” for her over the years.</p><p>“It feels good to get it out. It feels like not butterflies in your stomach but in your heart. It’s cool,” she said.</p><p>Older brother Prince explained how he felt protective of the family as the oldest of the Jackson kids.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘The way we were raised, me being the oldest… I feel like I should be the one that’s protecting the group,’ he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On her music, he said he could “hear” his sister’s deep-rooted pain after years of battling with mental illness.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>“I remember when my sister first played Geronimo for me, I can hear and feel all the emotion and pain and hurt that went into that song and I remember thinking this was a song that other people both could relate to but other people needed to hear,” he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Paris was featured in a Facebook Watch show, Unfiltered, which followed her and ex-boyfriend Gabriel as they made music.</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Thesun.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnp528bq3RnmSmoZOdrqa4jKOYnKOjpLu0ecqim6xn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-bj-griffin-agt-5136091.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is BJ Griffin?
