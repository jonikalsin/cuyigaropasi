He is a racer, and he has had this interest since he was 16 years old. His father’s car, a Chevrolet Impala, was the first vehicle he began using.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-913 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>He progressed to using a special vehicle dubbed Goliath 2.0. Due to the crashes, he was involved in, he almost died. He is still on the move and doing everything he can to support his dream and his son. Among these vehicles is the 1963 Chevy II Nova Wagon – The Black Box.</p><h3>Auto Shops</h3><p>Daddy Dave is the owner of a chain of auto-repair shops known as Comstock Auto Service. BendPak strongly supports his stores, as Dave cites them as his go-to equipment and tool manufacturers. The stores are praised for doing excellent work and providing stellar services without any “showboating or grandstanding.” – high marks for a celebrity shop.</p><h3>Street Outlaws</h3><p>Following the structured and controlled environment of “Pinks,” this show marked a significant shift in the media portrayal of drag racing. The show, which is set in Oklahoma, debuted on January 10, 2013.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-914 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>The show takes pride in having a cast that includes members of the infamous “list” – an underground list of the most elite names in the racing industry. When Dave met Justin Shearer (Big Chief), he immediately fit in and was dubbed “King of the Streets.” Daddy Dave’s first vehicle was a 1996 GMC Sonoma S10 pickup truck nicknamed “Goliath.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Goliath, like most street racing cars, was outfitted with gadgets and upgrades that transformed it from an industrial-model vehicle to a streamlined racing artwork.</p><p>The stakes are high in this sport, but Dave was well compensated, both financially and through the sponsorship of a construction magnate, Jackie Knox, who funded and supported Dave until tragedy struck in 2015.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-915 data-method=placement-service></span><h3>Pinks</h3><p>Despite years of street racing, “Pinks” was Daddy Dave’s first big break. A forerunner to the Discovery Channel show “Street Outlaws.” “Pinks investigated the culture of street racing in a highly controlled setting.” The show’s title was derived from the slang term “Racing for pinks,” which refers to the title deeds of a document as the stakes of the race. Dave made an appearance on the show in 2009.</p><p>There is little information about the show’s cast, so Dave’s progress and performance on the series are unknown. Dave met his future co-star, Justin Shearer, around this time.’</p><h2 id=h-frequently-asked-questions-about-daddy-dave>Frequently Asked Questions About Daddy Dave</h2><strong class=schema-faq-question>Who is Daddy Dave?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Dave is an American TV celebrity and streetcar racer, well known after he indulged himself in Street Outlaws on MTV.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-916 data-method=placement-service></span> <strong class=schema-faq-question>How old is Daddy Dave?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Dave is an American national born on 4 April 1973, in Shawnee, Oklahoma, United States.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span> <strong class=schema-faq-question>How tall is Daddy Dave?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Dave stands at a height of 5 feet 6 inches (1.73 meters).</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>Is Daddy Dave married?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Dаvе mаrrіеd Саѕѕіе, wіth whоm hе hаd а lоng rеlаtіоnѕhір, Маrсh 1, 2013.
