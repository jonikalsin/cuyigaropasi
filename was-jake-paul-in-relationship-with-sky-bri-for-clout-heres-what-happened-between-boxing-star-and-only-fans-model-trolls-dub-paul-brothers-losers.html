He recently made headlines for being featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Moreover, he has generated significant anticipation by confirming his upcoming match with professional boxer Nate Diaz, scheduled for August 5, 2023.</p><p>This article focuses on his former girlfriend, Sky Bri, who is an OnlyFans model and Instagram influencer. Recently, there have been discussions about the boxer's relationship with Sky Bri after his breakup with his long-term girlfriend Julia Rose. Let's explore whether Paul's involvement with Bri was solely for publicity or clout.</p><h2 class=split>‘This is for clout’</h2><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Jake Paul's opponent Andre August shares his views on KSI, Internet replies 'nobody knows you'</a></p><p>After Paul's on-and-off relationship with Rose came to an end in March 2021, he swiftly entered into a brief romantic encounter with Bri. According to Bri, her involvement with Paul was primarily driven by his desire for revenge against Rose. Supposedly, Paul had made his intentions clear from the start and didn't mind Bri gaining some attention from the situation.&nbsp;</p><p>During a recent appearance on the 'No Jumper' podcast, Bri shared the following statement, “The very first night, the first conversation we had, ‘This is for clout.’ He was like, ‘At the end of this, I want you to post it.” Further, she shared, "Get the clout from it whatever, and I’m probably going to make Julia mad and get the revenge that I need.” Bri revealed that Paul explicitly stated their involvement was solely to provoke his ex-girlfriend Julia. Also, she stated that Paul's intentions were to incite jealousy and anger in Julia as a form of revenge.</p><h2 class=split>‘Bigger losers’</h2><p>After watching the video of Bri, fans shared their stances in the ongoing discussion. One fan said, “I just gained 10x respect for jake paul.” Another said, “He didn’t do nothing wrong what did she want him to do.” Another YouTube user wrote, “Why y'all always mad. She's just said he was clear in his intentions and it was mutually beneficial.” Another user said, “So the Paul brothers are even bigger losers we already knew that tho.”</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Jake Paul reacts to GF Jutta Leerdam’s Instagram post with emojis as she clinches her sixth World Cup gold medal</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/3c6b87b6-2127-4aaa-b663-d7f611a26050.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/c9a03323-25f8-4685-bf75-bfa27f42321e.jpg><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Jake Paul takes a dig at fans for criticizing him for his upcoming fight against Andre August: 'Make up your mind'</a></p><span class=readpage-disclaimer>This article contains remarks made on the Internet by individual people and organizations.
