After his tweet got more widespread attention, the political commentator said on Mar. 3, “What I wrote here was a question: if the authorities in Texas are clearly and belligerently siding with the virus against humanity, why are we sending the vaccines there now? Vaccinations cannot, by themselves, overcome a Governor advocating for mass suicide.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>This was needlessly harsh and I apologize for it.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>I want (and wanted) everybody in Texas to get the vaccine.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>But it is heartbreaking to know its effect will be undermined by the idiots who run your state.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>I’ve apologized.

Now YOU guys get Abbott, Cornyn, Cruz, out of office,” referring to the state’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two Republican U.S. Senators</a> <strong>John Cornyn</strong> and <strong>Ted Cruz</strong>, who backed Abbott’s decision.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Moore on the other hand hasn’t apologized, but said Texans should get the vaccine and their politicians voted out of office. After his initial tweet, the Fahrenheit 9/11 filmmaker followed it up several hours later explaining himself. “Yes, we must and will find a way to vaccinate the poor and people of color in Texas. To Texans who say, hey, it’s not me – it’s the Governor! Well, then, impeach and remove him. We’re tired of this. Don’t mess with Texas?

The rest of us must find a way to protect ourselves from the policies and politicians of Texas,” and wrote that “Texas is no longer majority white. The 57% majority is Latinx and Black and Asian and Native American. So let’s do everything we can to help that majority remove the bigots and ignoramuses from office.

People held captive by the poor decisions of their elected officials do not deserve to be cut off from important life-saving services. Why does this even need to be said?”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Please lay off blaming the entire population of Texas for the actions of a stupid governor.

Discriminatory voter ID. Grotesque gerrymandering. All this contributes to low turnout. Only 4.7M Texans out of 29M voted for Abbott.” Even legendary newscaster and native Texan <strong>Dan Rather</strong> got in some subtle shade about Moore and Olbermann’s comments, tweeting, “Greetings from Texas. There are millions here who believe in masks and public health. To the rest of America, please understand this is a complex and diverse state – divisive hot takes from some notwithstanding.” Once again, the 89-year-old broadcasting icon is the voice of reason amid a loud debate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH10e49sZqahk52upriMpqaoqpViuKa106FkqKSSmr%2Burc2nZK2dqJbAbsLAnJqippViwbixxK2qaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./taylen-mosley-missing-pashun-son-alligator-mouth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pashun Jeffery Son Found Dead In Alligator Mouth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./james-van-der-beeks-net-worth-a-look-at-his.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>James Van Der Beek's Net Worth: A Look at His Wealth and Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./caden-conrique.html>Caden Conrique (Actor) Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Dating, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Career, Fac</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eva-longoria-net-worth.html>Eva Longoria Net Worth: Lifestyle &amp;amp; Income</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-zolciak-biermann.html>Kim Zolciak-Biermann Height, Weight, Age, Spouse, Family, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-controversy-surrounding-fsu-football.html>The Controversy Surrounding FSU Football</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-lance-armstrong-and-astronaut-neil-armstrong-related.html>Are Lance Armstrong and Astronaut Neil Armstrong related?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ.
