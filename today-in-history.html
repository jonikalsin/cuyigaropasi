This act required all Americans to set their clocks to standard time.

Within a year, the act was repealed after Americans complained about its effects on their lives and even their religion. Despite the act’s repeal, several states decided to uphold daylight savings, and Congress passed the 1996 Uniform Time Act, which required states to adhere to six months of standard time and six of daylight saving.</p><h2>1931: Nevada Legalizes Gambling</h2><p>The state of Nevada votes to legalize gambling in an effort to combat economic hardships brought on by the Great Depression.
