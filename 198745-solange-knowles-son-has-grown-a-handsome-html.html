The former spouses had Julez when the singer was only 18. They married in February 2004, just months before Julez was born. His birthday is on October 18, 2004.</p><p class=dh>Solange and Daniel stayed married for only three years. It came to a point that Solange <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://pagesix.com/2017/02/10/solange-relocating-for-ex-was-bittersweet/>felt isolated and alone</a>. She had been solely taking care of Julez when they moved to Idaho with Daniel who attended school there. Solange’s career took a backseat at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/819af1c7f442be17899c5f28cbdc26d7.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Solange Knowles and her son, Julez Smith attending an event in May 2014. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>THEIR FRIENDLY ARRANGEMENT</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>Though their marriage didn’t prosper, Solange and Daniel managed to become friendly co-parents.</p><p class=dh>“We co-parent really well. I’m able to say, ‘I need to finish this album, can you step up and take care of the boy?'” Solange <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/news/a1835/solange-knowles-0414/>said</a> in 2014 in an interview with Harper’s Bazaar.</p><p class=dh>Though Julez grew up mostly with his mother, Daniel constantly sees him. Father and son would often bond as evident in Daniel’s social media feeds.</p><p class=dh>Meanwhile, Solange, who recently split from her husband, <a class="me a" href=#>Alan Ferguson</a>, is a hands-on mother who makes Julez her number one priority. She uprooted from Brooklyn to New Orleans to ensure her son kept a stable set of friends and environment.</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>MORE ON JULEZ</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>Julez has already been showing interest in venturing into music like his mother but Solange is hesitant. If she had her way, she’d want him to be a diplomat.</p><p class=dh>This may also be the reason why she encouraged him to learn French. She told a fan who inquired about <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.essence.com/celebrity/solange-responds-fan-who-questions-why-her-son-speaks-french/>Julez’s fluency in the language</a> that it would help him connect with people when he travels to Africa.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpwcW9kanq0u8uapaCdXaC7sMPLnqpmq5%2Bjeqmt0maeq6eno3qieceapZ2rn6Kyb7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./marques-colston.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Marques Colston</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-ballack.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Ballack- Net worth, Height, Wife, Age, Bio, Nationality, Trophies</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./caden-conrique.html>Caden Conrique (Actor) Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Dating, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Career, Fac</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eva-longoria-net-worth.html>Eva Longoria Net Worth: Lifestyle &amp;amp; Income</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-zolciak-biermann.html>Kim Zolciak-Biermann Height, Weight, Age, Spouse, Family, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-controversy-surrounding-fsu-football.html>The Controversy Surrounding FSU Football</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-lance-armstrong-and-astronaut-neil-armstrong-related.html>Are Lance Armstrong and Astronaut Neil Armstrong related?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ.
