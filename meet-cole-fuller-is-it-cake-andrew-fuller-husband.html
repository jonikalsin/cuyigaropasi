On his Instagram bio, Cole writes, “28. Married to&nbsp;<a class=notranslate tabindex=0 href=#>@andrewjasonfuller</a>. Vegetarian. Gay. Sphynx cats. Owner of Des Moines Tutoring. Enjoy spelunking, hiking, travel, & music.”</p><p>His husband Andrew joined the Netflix show along with the other eight bakers. Andrew defeated fellow contestants <a href=#>Hemu Basu</a> and <a href=#>April Julian</a> in the finale, dubbed “Winner Fakes All,” by making a massive slice of what they considered their ultimate cake creation. He became the season winner after fooling celebrity guests Loni Love,&nbsp;SNL‘s&nbsp;Bobby Moynihan, and Queer Eye‘s&nbsp;Karamo Brown when the cake was put in a line of three real decoys.</p><p>As the final masterpiece, Andrew baked an elaborately designed leather-look luggage that bursts open with edible garments pouring out the sides. Inside was a white velvet cake with mascarpone cheese, espresso buttercream, and ladyfingers to resemble a tiramisu, and a pistachio cake with honey rose buttercream and fig jam to resemble a pistachio cake.</p><p>Andrew made a total profit of $80,000. That’s the $50,000 prize money plus an extra $30,000 he won in the ‘winner stays on’ relay portion of the game, where each round had a prize pool of up to $10,000 to be won.</p><p>Andrew spoke on the camera, “This is so much more to me than just money. I just feel so humbled by this experience, and I feel like I’ve proven I don’t need to fit in with everybody else. You can still reach for whatever weird, wild, totally ridiculous dream you have, and you can achieve that. This has been the ride of my life.”</p><h3><strong>When Did Cole Fuller And His Husband Andrew Fuller Tie The Knot?</strong></h3><p>Cole Fuller and his husband Andrew Fuller tied the knots in 2010. So you know, they have been happily married for over a decade.</p><p>In 2014, Cole and his husband were featured on Des Moines Register for transforming their home into a macabre escape. The outlet described walking into their home “feels like walking into a Tim Burton film, a wonderfully weird mix of Victorian stylings, surreal decor and a hint of playful scariness.”</p><p>The house sits near the edge of Des Moines’ King Irving neighborhood.</p><p>Cole’s husband told the news outlet, “People take this life so seriously. I want my home to be an escape where people can come in and talk about it and feel like they’re in a place they’ve never been before.” Whereas Cole added, “We seem to have both independently embraced the macabre aesthetic that isn’t reminiscent of Martha Stewart Living. It’s a variety that keeps things interesting.”</p><p>Besides the love for creating a macabre living, they also share the love for paranormal investigation. They once paid money to spend the night in the “Murder House” of Villisca, Iowa.</p><h3><strong>Cole Fuller Age</strong></h3><p>Born in 1987, Cole Fuller fuller is 35 years old.</p><h3><strong>Cole Fuller Job</strong></h3><p>Cole Fuller is a graduate of BCLUW High School in Conrad, Iowa, in 2005. After completing high school education, he enrolled at Lipscomb University in Nashville, Tennessee. He graduated in 2009 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Biology with Psychology and Chemistry minors.</p><p>Cole had a passion for learning and teaching. This inspired him to start Des Moines Tutoring in 2009.&nbsp; He currently tutors math, science, and test prep students. Whereas his business offers math, science, and language tutoring, individual and group test prep courses, study skills training, and “Learn to Grow” courses.</p><p>In 2017, Des Moines Tutoring was also chosen for the top spot for Des Moines Tutoring Centers by Three Best Rated.</p><p>In January 2018, Cole was featured on WHO13 Des Moines after three West Des Moines students earned perfect ACT scores. He spoke with the local news channel and told, “It’s not a test that bodes well for students scoring perfectly, very often. It’s very, very, very challenging, and once again the students have to know the material inside and out. As well as have luck on their side, just so they don’t even just misread a single question. If you are scoring at that accuracy, you cannot be rushing through the test”.</p><p>He also addressed the amount of focus and endurance necessary to have to be successful on the ACT test.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Cole Fuller From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Cole Fuller currently lives in Des Moines, Iowa.
