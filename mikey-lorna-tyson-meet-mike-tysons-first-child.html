Mike Tyson is one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time. He dominated the boxing world from 1985 to 2005 when he stopped competing. During his career, he reigned as the undisputed world heavyweight champion from 1987 to 1990.</p><p>The heavyweight boxing legend has a lot of victories in the ring. However, his personal life has its fair share of ups and downs. From serving jail terms to messy divorces to rape, physical assault accusations, and drinking problems. Nevertheless, he rose above the obstacles. According to Skysports, he is “perhaps the most ferocious fighter to step into a professional ring.”&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from his success in the ring, he has also been in several marriages and has fathered seven children. Among them is his first-born daughter, Mikey Lorna Tyson.</p><p>Here’s everything we know about the legend’s oldest daughter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Mikey_Lorna_Tyson_Mike_Tyson_and_Robin_Givens_Daughter></span>Is Mikey Lorna Tyson, Mike Tyson, and Robin Givens’ Daughter?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While most people believe Mikey is the daughter of Mike and his first wife, Robin Givens, she is not. Mike’s first marriage to Robins Given was tumultuous, with allegations of violence, spousal abuse, and mental instability. The former couple married on February 7, 1988, and parted ways a year later on February 14, 1989.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/photo_2023-06-18_07-36-29-fotor-2023061874054.jpg><p>Givens was an actress at the time. On the other hand, Mike was finding his footing in the boxing industry. In a joint interview in September 1988, Givens opened up about what it was like being married to the boxing legend.</p><p>She described it as torture, pure hell, and worse than she could imagine. A few months after the interview, they went their separate ways and didn’t have a child together.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Mikey_Lorna_Tysons_Mother></span>Who Is Mikey Lorna Tyson’s Mother?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Following his divorce from Givens in 1989, Mike got into a relationship with a model, Kimberly Scarborough. Even though several reports allege that Scarborough and Mike were officially a couple, they were not. Scarborough and the boxing legend started dating after his divorce from his wife.</p><p>However, their relationship went downhill when she became pregnant with Mikey. Mike was not ready to become a father then and told her to get an abortion. Although the model went to the clinic for an abortion as planned, she changed her mind. She left the clinic without getting an abortion.&nbsp;</p><p>Initially, the boxing legend took up his fatherly duties. He gave her money to get the needed baby essentials but later denied paternity a few months into the pregnancy. Consequently, Scarborough had her daughter on July 31, 1990, in Harlem, New York City, and raised her alone for the first few months.</p><p>Scarborough sued the boxer for paternity when Mikey was eight months old. The paternity suit confirmed her claim, and as a result, Mike had a change of heart. Although the details of their settlement were not disclosed, his child was well provided for. He came to terms with his new role as a father and became more involved in his daughter’s life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mikey_Lorna_Tyson_Weight_Struggles></span>Mikey Lorna Tyson Weight Struggles<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mikey revealed that she struggled with obesity like most people from her paternal side of the family. She added that her father weighed 200 lbs in his early teens. However, the boxer got rid of excess weight thanks to his fitness training.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, the boxer’s sister, Denise Anderson, was not as lucky. She died at 24 in February 1990 and weighed between 300 and 400 lbs. Several reports also claim that Mike’s mother also struggled with weight-related problems.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Mikey took to her Instagram page in a now-deleted post to share her fitness and weight-loss journey. She revealed how therapeutic cooking has been and shared some photos on social media.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/photo_2023-06-18_07-36-35-fotor-202306187398.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mikey_Lorna_Tyson_Modeling_Career></span>Mikey Lorna Tyson Modeling Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Growing up, Mikey was inspired by plus-size models such as Crystal Renn. She told herself that one day it would be her on the front covers of magazines that featured plus-size models. Hence, she took her fitness journey and diet seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>The Harlem-born celebrity child did a cover shoot for <a href=#>Queen Size Magazine</a> in November 2016 and has since appeared in other magazines. In one of her interviews, she opened up about her dream of designing a plus-sized fashion line and briefly studied at the Parsons School of Design.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/photo_2023-06-18_07-36-41-fotor-2023061874018.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mikey_Lorna_Tysons_Relationship_With_Her_Siblings></span>Mikey Lorna Tyson’s Relationship With Her Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mikey Lorna Tyson has six siblings, Rayna Tyson, Amir Tyson, Miguel Leon Tyson, Exodus Tyson, Milan Tyson, and Morocco Tyson. Mikey shares a close-knit bond with her siblings, except Exodus, who died tragically at four. She died in May 2009 from a tragic treadmill accident at home.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence she has five surviving half-siblings from her father’s marriage to several women and has a good relationship with them. Like most <a href=#>celebrity kids</a>, Mikey Lorna Tyson lives away from the spotlight and keeps her life private. Hence there are no details regarding her relationship status.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqq3xLJkpaeio65uwNispqdlnZqytXnMoqKeZaSuwLC60madoqqjqXqktMilm2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./prestonplayz.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>PrestonPlayz Net Worth, Age, Wife, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./keegan-bradley.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Keegan Bradley</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./caden-conrique.html>Caden Conrique (Actor) Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Dating, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Career, Fac</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eva-longoria-net-worth.html>Eva Longoria Net Worth: Lifestyle &amp;amp; Income</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-zolciak-biermann.html>Kim Zolciak-Biermann Height, Weight, Age, Spouse, Family, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-controversy-surrounding-fsu-football.html>The Controversy Surrounding FSU Football</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-lance-armstrong-and-astronaut-neil-armstrong-related.html>Are Lance Armstrong and Astronaut Neil Armstrong related?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ.
